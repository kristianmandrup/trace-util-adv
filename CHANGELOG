31-10-2009
==========

* Changed convenience filter creation methods to use :i_, :x_, :iy_ and :xy_, fx :xy_method_filter (note the underscore!)
* Added first unit test to ensure this works as expected. More unit tests to come to cover the framework as it stabilizes... 

* Planning to possible use Singleton pattern 
 
* Use duck typing, extend Hash, Array and Symbol  

* TODO
  rule_allow_action(name) NEEDS MAJOR CLEANUP AND REFACTOR!!!


27-10-2009
==========
* Created filter_factory.rb
- will include convenience methods to create and operate on filters
- should be used when registering filters in all cases

* improved README documentation

NOTE: 
Framework has perhaps become overly complex - simplify, and refactor next week!
