TODO:
----
FIX TODO:
- create filters from hash doesn't work :(
- test_filter_exec (see current_test)


---
Add time to context for before- and after handle calls. Enable tracing time output 
Allow for comparing time it takes to complete method and act upon it!
Store method with come context on stack, to allow look up to compare with previous calls. Perhaps find average time it took to call this method etc.

Support Intrusive trace statements
----------------------------------
- trace messages can be inserted in your application code and should be handled by the tracing framework.
- Currently the framework only supports tracing of method entry and exits.

Introduce new rule outcomes
---
 :include_yield - set temp outcome to include and then yield, allowing other rule to exclude
 :exclude_yield - set temp outcome to exclude and then yield, allowing other rule to include

Refactor MsgContextRule 
-----------------------
- see message_filters.rb
- BaseFilter should extend this.

Refactor design
- Modularize even more!

Test String appender
- log string to file

Test library in general
- functions as expected?
- easy to use?
- create RSpec tests?
