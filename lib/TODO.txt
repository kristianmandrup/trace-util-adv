TODO:

Support Intrusive trace statements
----------------------------------
- trace messages can be inserted in your application code and should be handled by the tracing framework.
- Currently the framework only supports tracing of method entry and exits.

Introduce new rule outcomes
---
 :include_yield - set temp outcome to include and then yield, allowing other rule to exclude
 :exclude_yield - set temp outcome to exclude and then yield, allowing other rule to include

Refactor MsgContextRule 
-----------------------
- see message_filters.rb
- BaseFilter should extend this.

Refactor design
- Modularize even more!

Test String appender
- log string to file

Test library in general
- functions as expected?
- easy to use?
- create RSpec tests?
